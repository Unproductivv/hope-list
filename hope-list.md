# Hey everyone!

So, I know the last few days have been... *rough*, for most of us. 

We'll likely all need time to recover. 



So, what I've been doing is **collecting**.

Collecting a **lot** of stuff.

Stuff that sparks joy.

Stuff that has personally helped me keep my spirits up recently, and that I hope will help you all too.



This'll be in list format, and I'll also be uploading it to my GitHub, just for ease of sharing. 

To every member that has reached out a helping hand in the last few days, my gratitude is immeasurable.

As this will be available through GitHub, I would greatly appreciate contributions.

Append them below, I'll review them, and add them to the list. 

I will, of course, credit any contributor next to their contribution, so please, do leave a preferred name as well, so I may properly label.
